# Getting Started with NimbusWorkspaces

NimbusWorkspaces is a collaborative platform that lets distributed teams share documents, chat in real time, and automate project workflows. This guide answers common onboarding questions.

## Creating your workspace

1. Visit https://nimbus.example.com/signup.
2. Choose "Create a workspace".
3. Verify your email address.
4. Invite teammates directly from the dashboard or via email.

### Workspace roles

- **Owner** – full administrative access, including billing.
- **Manager** – manage members and integrations.
- **Contributor** – create and edit content.
- **Viewer** – read-only access to shared folders.

## Resetting your password

If you lose access to your NimbusWorkspaces account, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://nimbus.example.com/login.
2. Click **Forgot password**.
3. Enter your workspace email address.
4. Open the reset link sent to your inbox.
5. Choose a new password that meets the complexity requirements (12+ characters, at least one symbol).

If the reset email does not arrive within five minutes, ask an Owner to trigger a manual reset from the **Members** panel.

## Troubleshooting login issues

- Ensure your workspace subdomain is correct (e.g., `team-name.nimbus.example.com`).
- Clear browser cache or try a private window.
- If you use SSO, verify that your identity provider session is active.
- Contact support with the error code displayed on screen.
